# Legal-Document-Automation-Tool
"Streamline your legal paperwork process with our Legal Documentation Assistant"

Introduction:

We have developed an innovative tool that automates the process of legal document preparation, aiming to reduce the time and cost associated with it. Our tool is designed to assist lawyers and customers in India, providing them with a user-friendly interface to create standardized legal documents.

Background:

In India, preparing legal documents can be a time-consuming and expensive process, often requiring the assistance of lawyers. This can be a challenge for individuals who cannot afford legal representation. Our tool aims to bridge this gap by providing an accessible and affordable solution for legal document preparation.

Methodology:

Our tool utilizes a combination of technologies, including React, Axios, Flask, Google Cloud Computing, NLTK, TensorFlow and Keras. We have developed a chatbot using NLTK and TensorFlow, which is trained on a dataset of legal queries and answers. The chatbot provides information and assistance to users who have questions about legal documents.


The tool works by allowing users to input their details into a web page. The program retrieves the relevant document from the cloud, based on the user's selection (Rental Agreement, Divorce Agreement, Adoption Agreement, or Sale Deed Agreement). The algorithm replaces the values of the original document with the user's given details, generating a customized legal document. The document is then sent back to the web page, where the user can download it.


Application:

Our tool has numerous applications, benefiting both lawyers and customers. By automating the process of legal document preparation, we can reduce the time and cost associated with it. This tool can be used by individuals who cannot afford legal representation, providing them with an accessible and affordable solution.


Additionally, the chatbot provides a convenient way for users to get their queries answered, without the need for lengthy consultations with lawyers.


Technical Details:

Front End: React

Back End: Flask

Cloud Computing: Google Cloud Computing

We have developed our own queries for the chatbot, using NLTK and TensorFlow for training. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of legal queries and answers, and it provides information and assistance to users who have questions about legal documents.


Conclusion:

Our tool automates legal document preparation, making it faster, cheaper, and more accessible for lawyers and customers in India. It leverages advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and natural language processing to generate customized legal documents based on user input. The tool can revolutionize the legal document preparation process in India by reducing the time and cost associated with it.
